\defmodule {NormaLaminated}

 This class implements theoretical bounds on the length of the shortest
 nonzero vector in a lattice, based on the densest sphere packing in 
 {\em laminated} lattices. The length of vectors is computed using the
 ${\cal L}_2$ norm. The bounding lengths, for a lattice of rank $k$ 
 containing $m$ points per unit volume in dimension $t$, are given by
 $\ell_t^* = \gamma_t m^{k/t}$ for $t \ge k$, where the $\gamma_t$ are
 the lattice constants for the best {\em laminated} lattices \cite{mCON99a}.

 \tabb Constructor for the bounds obtained for laminated lattices. The 
   lattices are those of rank $k$,
   with $m$ points per unit volume, in all dimensions  $\le t$.
   The bias factor \texttt{beta} $= \beta$ gives more weight to some of the
   dimensions. %: taking $\beta < 1$ inflates the figure of merit by
 %  $(1/\beta)^t$, thus weakening the requirements for large $t$ in a 
 %  worst-case figure of merit.
   Restriction: $t \le 48$.
