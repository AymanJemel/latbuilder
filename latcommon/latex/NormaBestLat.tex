\defmodule {NormaBestLat}

 This class implements the {\em best} theoretical bounds on the length of the
 shortest nonzero vector in a lattice, based on the densest sphere packing in 
 lattices.  The length of a vector is computed using the
 ${\cal L}_2$ norm. The bounding lengths for a lattice of rank $k$, 
  containing $m$ points per unit volume in dimension $t$, are given by
 $\ell_t^* = \gamma_t m^{k/t}$ for $t \ge k$, where the $\gamma_t$ are
 the lattice constants for the {\em best} known lattices \cite{mCON99a}.

 \tabb Constructor for the best bounds obtained for lattices. The 
   lattices are those of rank $k$,
   with $m$ points per unit volume, for all dimensions  $\le t$.
   The bias factor \texttt{beta} $= \beta$ gives more weight to some of the
   dimensions. %: taking $\beta < 1$ inflates the figure of merit by
  % $(1/\beta)^t$, thus weakening the requirements for large $t$ in a 
  % worst-case figure of merit.
  Restriction: $t \le 48$.
