\defmodule {NormaRogers}

 This class implements the {\em Rogers} bounds on the density of 
 sphere packing. The length of vectors is computed using the
 ${\cal L}_2$ norm. The bounding lengths, for a lattice of rank $k$ 
  containing $m$ points per unit volume in dimension $t$, are given by
 $\ell_t^* = \gamma_t m^{k/t}$ for $t \ge k$, where the $\gamma_t$ are
the {\em Rogers} lattice constants.

 \tabb Constructor for the Rogers bounds. The lattices are those of rank $k$,
   with $m$ points per unit volume, in all dimensions  $\le t$.
   The bias factor \texttt{beta} $= \beta$ gives more weight to some of the
   dimensions. There is no restriction on the dimension $t$ which can be
   larger than 48.
