\defmodule {vec\_vec\_lzz}
  
This class builds rectangular matrices of \texttt{long}'s and is very similar
to some NTL classes for matrices of integers. It has been added for compatibility
with NTL in declaration of types and method calls. The macros used provide 
template-like classes for dynamic-sized rectangular matrices of \texttt{long}'s.

NTL_vector_decl(Vec,vec_vec_zz)
\endcode
\tab This macro declares a class \texttt{vec\_vec\_zz} of rectangular matrices of
\texttt{Long}'s (see module \texttt{vec\_lzz.tex}). 
The declaration \texttt{vec\_vec\_zz M;} creates a $0\times0$
matrix \texttt{M}. The statement \texttt{M.SetDims(2, 4);} grows this matrix
to dimensions $2\times 4$. A matrix entry can be accessed as \texttt{M[i][j]}.
Indexing starts at 0.

 $\scriptstyle{<<}$ and $\scriptstyle{>>}$ for type  \texttt{vec\_vec\_zz}.
