\defmodule {mat\_double}

This class builds matrices of \texttt{double}'s and is very similar to some NTL
classes for matrices of reals. It has been added for compatibility with NTL in 
declaration of types and method calls. The macros used provide template-like
classes for dynamic-sized arrays of \texttt{double}'s.
