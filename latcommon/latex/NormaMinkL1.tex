\defmodule {NormaMinkL1}

 This class implements theoretical bounds on the length of the shortest
 nonzero vector in a lattice, based on the densest sphere packing in 
 space.  The length of vectors is computed using the
 ${\cal L}_1$ norm. Here,  the length of the shortest nonzero vector
gives the minimal number of hyperplanes that cover all the points of
the lattice. The following upper bound in this case was established by 
Marsaglia \cite{rMAR68a} by  applying the general convex body theorem of
 Minkowski:
\[ 
  \ell_t^* = (t! m^k)^{1/t} = \gamma_t m^{k/t},
\]
 for  lattices of rank $k$, containing $m$ points per unit volume,
 in dimension $t$.
 The lattice constants are thus $\gamma_t = (t!)^{1/t}$.

 \tabb Constructor for the Marsaglia's bounds with the ${\cal L}_1$ norm. The 
   lattices are those of rank $k$, with $m$ points per unit volume, in all
   dimensions  $\le t$. The bias factor \texttt{beta} $= \beta$ gives more weight
   to some of the dimensions. Restriction: $t \le 48$.
