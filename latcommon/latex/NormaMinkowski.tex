\defmodule {NormaMinkowski}

 This class implements {\em Minkowski\/}'s theoretical bounds on the length of
 the shortest nonzero vector in a lattice. The length of a vector is
 computed using the ${\cal L}_2$ norm. The bounding lengths, for a lattice
 of rank $k$   containing $m$ points per unit volume in dimension $t$, are
 given by $\ell_t^* = \gamma_t m^{k/t}$ for $t \ge k$, where the $\gamma_t$
 are the {\em Minkowski} lattice constants.

 \tabb Constructor for the bounds obtained for Minkowski lattices. The 
   lattices are those of rank $k$,
   with $m$ points per unit volume, in all dimensions  $\le t$.
   The bias factor \texttt{beta} $= \beta$ gives more weight to some of the
   dimensions. Restriction: $t \le 48$.
